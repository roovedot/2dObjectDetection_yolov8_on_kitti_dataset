# Custom Yolov8 Object Detection Model for Autonomous Driving Applications
This is the **first version** of a custom Object detection Model aimed at **recognising cars, bicicles, pedestrians, and other obstacles which may appear on the road through a dashcam.** 

The objective is to **implement this model to assist, in real time, a Self-Driving Car** in making precise and more informed decisions.

To make this model, I fine-tuned ultralytics **Yolov8** Model on **KITTI Dataset** images (2d object labels)
